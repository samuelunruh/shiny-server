## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r math, context="render", echo=FALSE}
x <- round(42 * rnorm(n=1), 0)
question(sprintf("Suppose $x = %s$. Choose the correct statement:", x),
  answer(sprintf("$\\sqrt{x} = %d$", x + 1)),
  answer(sprintf("$x ^ 2 = %d$", x^2), correct = TRUE),
  answer("$\\sin x = 1$"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
